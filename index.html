    <!-- about this page -->
    <div class="grid-item">
      <p>On this page you'll find my completed works, past commissions, and current projects I'm working on! I also have included a for fun section of my pets and the shenanigans they get into. This page is to show you the work I've done and the skills I've developed in coding and design.</p>
      <p>The Completed Code projects section is a list of codes I've completed as I've gone through my schooling with Correlation-1. These showcase my skills and capabilities in not only HTML but various other coding languages. The Work in Progress Section goes over what I'm currently working on whether it is coding or design related. I'll provide my plans and goals for my projects and the steps I've taken so far.
      </p>
      <p>The pet shenanigans page is dedicated to all funny content for my two pets Luci and Papaya! I wanted to include some lighthearted content that also allows my audience to feel connected to me. Besides, who wouldn't want to see cute pictures of animals?

    <!-- my journey -->
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>My Journey So Far...</h3>
      <p>I have always been a creative individual from a young age. I went to Mesa Community College to pursue a career in art. I knew technology would be the future so I wanted to take my creativity from paper to the screen. I graduated during the beginning of the Covid pandemic and was laid off from my part time job. I found immediate work through Amazon and fell in love with the company and the opportunities it gave me that I otherwise would not have. One of them currently being my education through correlation-1. When I was studying for digital illustration I had always been curious about building websites. Unfortunately my college didn't dive much into it unless I changed career paths. However, correlation-1 has given me the opportunity to explore web development more and combine my previous design skills with it.
